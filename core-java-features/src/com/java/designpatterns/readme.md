What is design patterns and why it is required..?
- Design patterns are proven solutions to commonly occurring design problems in software development. They provide reusable and well-tested solutions that help developers tackle design challenges efficiently and effectively. 
- Design patterns capture the collective knowledge and experience of seasoned developers and provide a set of best practices for solving specific problems.

Here are some reasons why design patterns are important in software development:

- Reusability: Design patterns promote code reusability by providing pre-defined solutions to common design problems. Developers can leverage these patterns in their projects, saving time and effort in designing and implementing solutions from scratch.

- Maintainability: Design patterns enhance the maintainability of code by promoting modular and well-organized designs. By following established patterns, code becomes easier to understand, update, and maintain over time.

- Scalability: Design patterns facilitate the development of scalable software systems. They provide guidelines and structures that can be easily extended and modified to accommodate evolving requirements without significant code changes.

- Flexibility: Design patterns promote flexibility and adaptability in software design. They allow developers to introduce new features or alter existing functionalities without impacting the overall system structure.

- Communication and Collaboration: Design patterns provide a common language and vocabulary for developers to communicate and share ideas. By using well-known design patterns, team members can better understand and collaborate on the software design.

- Problem-solving: Design patterns serve as a toolkit for solving common design problems. They encapsulate proven solutions and best practices, allowing developers to focus more on solving domain-specific problems rather than reinventing solutions for generic design challenges.

- Performance: Design patterns can help improve performance by providing optimized solutions to specific problems. These patterns have been refined over time, considering performance considerations and trade-offs.

- Industry Standards: Design patterns represent widely accepted industry standards and best practices. Familiarity with design patterns allows developers to understand and work with existing codebases and libraries, as many frameworks and libraries are built upon these patterns.

By incorporating design patterns into software development, developers can benefit from the collective wisdom of the software development community, improve the quality of their code, and build robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
**There are several types of design patterns commonly used in Java. 
Here are some of the main categories:**

1. **Creational Patterns:**
    - Singleton Pattern
    - Factory Pattern
    - Builder Pattern
    - Prototype Pattern
    - Abstract Factory Pattern

2. **Structural Patterns:**
    - Adapter Pattern
    - Decorator Pattern
    - Composite Pattern
    - Proxy Pattern
    - Bridge Pattern
    - Flyweight Pattern
    - Facade Pattern

3. **Behavioral Patterns:**
    - Observer Pattern
    - Strategy Pattern
    - Template Method Pattern
    - Command Pattern
    - Iterator Pattern
    - Visitor Pattern
    - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    - State Pattern
    - Mediator Pattern
    - Interpreter Pattern
    - Memento Pattern

4. **Architectural Patterns:**
    - Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
    - Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern
    - Dependency Injection Pattern
    - Repository Pattern
    - Service Locator Pattern
    - Layered Architecture Pattern
    - Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

Each category addresses different aspects of software design and provides solutions to specific design problems. 
- Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, 
- Structural patterns deal with object composition and relationships, 
- Behavioral patterns handle communication and interaction between objects, and 
- Architectural patterns provide guidance for organizing and structuring entire 
  systems or modules.

It's important to note that design patterns are not specific to Java and 
can be applied in various programming languages. 
They are reusable solutions that have been proven effective in solving 
recurring design problems.
