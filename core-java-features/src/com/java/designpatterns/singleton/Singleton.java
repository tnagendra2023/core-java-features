/** In Java, the best optimized approach for implementing the Singleton design pattern
 is to use the "Bill Pugh Singleton"
 or the "Initialization-on-demand holder idiom."
 This approach provides lazy initialization of the singleton instance
 along with thread safety without the need for explicit synchronization.
 Here's how you can implement it:
* */
public class Singleton {

    // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    /**In this approach, the Singleton class contains a private static nested class
    called SingletonHelper. The static instance of the Singleton class is
    created when the SingletonHelper class is initialized,
    which only happens when the getInstance() method is called for the first time.
    This initialization is thread-safe due to the guarantees provided by the Java language.
*/    private static class SingletonHelper {
         private static final Singleton instance=new Singleton();
    }

    /**Using this approach, the Singleton instance is created
    only when it is actually requested, providing lazy initialization.
    Additionally, it avoids the need for explicit synchronization,
    resulting in better performance.
    This design pattern is recommended for most scenarios
    where you require a Singleton instance.*/
